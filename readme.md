# About
This program was orginaly written to help out the youtube channel Unmedicated & Dysfunctional keep track of their missing vidoes. This program is dedicated to help content creators know what is happening to thier content and let them know if something happens to it. YouTubes terms of serivce allow for the removal of videos with no notication. We hope to fix this by allowing more infromation to be kept by creators.


# How I work

### Day 0
Collect all videos for all channels

### Every  hour
I check each channel and see what the video count is, if it is greater I request the new video

IF however it is less then it was before I check all the videos and find the missing one

### Every Day
I check the current list of videos to see if a video was removed against the enitre database.
